  - NEO-M8U - [https://content.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/NEO-M8U_DataSheet_UBX-15015679.pdf]
  - Protocol Description - [https://content.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/products/documents/u-blox8-M8_ReceiverDescrProtSpec_UBX-13003221.pdf]
  - Integration Manual - [https://content.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/NEO-M8U_HardwareIntegrationManual_UBX-15016700.pdf]
  - Uses UART (D_SEL=1) mode to communicate with the microcontroller
  - Default UART config: 9600-8N1
  - I2C and USB Pins unused
  - nRESET, nSAFEBOOT, and EXTINT connected to microcontroller
  - TIMEBASE signal used to sync the RTC on the microcontroller to UTC (1Hz?)
- Footprint and Symbol created for NEO-M8U

- SD Interface
  - Wanted interface to be SDMMC2, which is on the D2 Bus matrix, but the pin layout was inconvenient. This requires the AXI bus to handle SD interfacing, likely with DMA across the AHB and AXI domains between CM4 and CM7
  - SDMMC1 is used because the pin positions are more convenient for routing
  - SD_D3 and SD_CMD pulled up through STM32
  - Added TPS22917 as load switch to turn on SD card
  - Added EMIF06-MSD02N16 for EMI protection and termination resistors
  - SD Power up sequence:
    - Detect SD card (SD_DETECT pulled low)
    - Enable Load switch (SD_EN high)
    - Test communciation
  - SD Power down sequence:
    - Detect SD removed (SD_DETECT pulled high)
    - Disable Load Switch (SD_EN low)
    - Display error stating SD card removed
